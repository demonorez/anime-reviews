# Anime-Review-King!

Pre-Covid, I never really cared about Anime but once all the live TV shows went on hiatus, I ended up falling in love with it again and started asking everyone I knew for recommendations. 

# [Try it here!](https://anime-review-masters.fly.dev/)

# [Here's how I planned it out](https://trello.com/b/glUQw0ps/review-rave-site#)

This is a site that I created for anime fans. You can create, review and update Anime as well as check out other users and their watchlists.
